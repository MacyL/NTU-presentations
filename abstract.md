# 簡介
在歐洲,歷史語言學創建於19世紀,通過比較不同語言的語料,進而歸納出語言之間的親屬關係以及語系的演化過程。今日廣為人知的印歐語系即是語言學家藉由一組組的詞彙緩步分析建構而出的第一個語系。由於比照法成功地建造出印歐語系的架構, 語言學家將此方法推廣至世界各地,進而構築了大大小小族繁不及備載的語系。如此龐大的工程憑藉著語言學家們不斷地收集語料與歸納統整,已對少數特定語系有清晰的認識。然而,三百多年之後的今日,我們對於多數的語系仍然只有模糊的概念,甚至某些語系的命名恰當與否,歷史語言學界依舊爭論不休。目前存在的語料提供了龐大且零散的資訊,僅憑藉著語言學家們做歸納統整與分析, 可想而知研究進度的緩慢是可以預期的。

在過去的數十年間,許多詞彙語料逐漸電子化,此舉正因應了跨領域研究的趨勢。電腦可取代重複且枯燥無味的資料前處理,語音序列比對,初步的同源詞偵測,最後找出不同語言之間的聲音對應關係。語言學家可適度地介入各個處理階段做調整並且判讀結果。由於每一個步驟都有不同的挑戰, 舉例而言,資料的呈現型態就有不同的格式,不同資料使用的詞彙可能是同義而非相同的詞彙,音變與意變可能造成同源詞的偵測精準度下降,電腦不可能完全取代人力。高效率(Efficiency)以及一致性(Consistency)是資訊處理的特徵,人腦貴在可適應性(Flexibility)以及增進分析正確性(Accuracy), 兩個領域相輔相成即是我們的計劃核心價值--電腦輔助比照法（computer-assisted language comparison）。

本次演講的主題將電腦輔助比照法分成三個部分。Tiago Tresoldi博士, 將講解我們已研發的演算法及工具(Softwares and methods),博士生吳梅忻會示範如何將已知的工具互相結合成為一個半自動的流程(Interface and workflows), 博士生Nathanael E. Schweikhard會近一步闡述文本註釋以及實例應用(Data annotation and modeling)。

# Abstract
Historical linguistics developed in the 19th century in Europe. The genealogical relationships and the diachronic evolution of the language family are revealed via comparing lexical items of the interested languages. For example, the well-known Indo-European language family is the first language family which was identified by using the comparative method. This method has been widely applied, and linguists have found lots of language families in various sizes in the world. Today, historical linguists have made groundbreaking findings to some specific language families by repetitively applying comparative method. Nevertheless, we have limited knowledge about most of the language families in the world, some language families are even under debates about the labels. The issue lies in that the massive and sporadic linguistic data has reached the practical limits of the traditional comparative method.

Because of the interdisciplinary studies is under the spotlight over recent decades, a substantial amount of linguistic data has been digitalized and lots of computer algorithms have developed. While existing methods emphasize on completely computer-driven, our project, also known as the computer-assisted language comparison, dedicates on developing methods which integrate informatics and historical linguistics. The reason to take a semi-automatic strategy is that many issues cannot be solved solely by computer programs, for example, the various formats of lexical data, the glosses are not always the same annotation, sound changes and semantic shifts might lower the accuracy of cognate detection. In the situation that the computer applications are not capable of fully replacing experts' experience and intuition, and experts do not have enough time to analyse the massive amounts of data, a computer-assisted approach is thus developed. The computing power can take over the boring and repetitive tasks, such as, preprocessing raw data, phonetic sequences alignments, cognate detections and lastly, the sound correspondences. The programs can deliver, although not perfect, but convincing results. And experts are encouraged to intervene at any stage to adjust the inputs and the outputs. Our goal is to develop a framework which combine the efficiency and consistency of computing power and the flexibility as well as accuracy of expert judgements.

This talk, the fundamentals of computer-assisted language comparison is divided into three sections. Dr. Tiago Tresoldi will introduce the softwares and methods which our group have developed. PhD student Mei-Shin Wu will present the interfaces and the semi automatic workflows which combines all the existing computation tools. PhD student Nathanael E. Schweikhard will further illustrate data annotation and the modeling.
